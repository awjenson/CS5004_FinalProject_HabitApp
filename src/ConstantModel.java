	// All of its variables should be accessible from the outside and unchangeable
	
	// should be accessible from the outside = use "public" keyword
	// "static" keyword is used for a constant variable that is the same for every instance of a class
	// and unchangeable = use "final" keyword
	
	// Constants naming in Java: should be all UPPERCASE with words separated by underscores ("_").

	// The static keyword in Java is used to share the same variable or method of a given class.
	// The static keyword is used for a constant variable (or a method) that is the same for every instance of a class.
	// Static variables and methods are allocated memory space only once during the execution of the program. 
	// This memory space is shared among all instances of the class, which makes static members useful for maintaining global state or shared functionality.
