/* INHERITANCE: Classes and objects created through inheritance are tightly coupled because 
 * changing the parent or superclass in an inheritance relationship risks breaking your code
 * 
 * COMPOSITION: Classes and objects created through composition are loosely coupled, meaning that 
 * you can more easily change the component parts without breaking your code
